# Hyperspecter Supercontinuum
Hyperspecter Supercontinuum enables hyperspectral CARS/SRS imaging from the fingerprint-to-CH region by utilizing a femtosecond laser as a pump and a PCF as a supercontinuum source for a broadband Stokes. Some functionality is borrowed from Jeremy Porquez's [Microscoper app](https://github.com/JeremyPorquez/MicroscoperPython).


## Updating the GUI
Run the `convert_ui.bat` file in the `Hyperspecter\hyperspecter\gui` directory within the virtual environment.
